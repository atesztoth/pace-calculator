# Pace calculator

## Why?

I don't know, I just wanted to write a server in Rust using Axum and ... well this turned out.

Okay, there was actually a little more motivation. \
I wanted to have a very simple calculator that I can use from any place, even from my phone without
downloading anything to calculate paces for me. \
Current calculators I know are just not convenient enough.

### Deployment?

In progress!
